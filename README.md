# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. *It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.* 

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
  * The biggest learning goal is to learn Git and GitHub in a group setting.  And to drive home early ruby logic concepts.
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
  * Without prior knowledge of either method, we will revisit after testing each throughout iteration 1 and 2.
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
  * Typically like asynchronous communication because I work at odd hours.  Something like Slack or DMs is best.
  * Direct communication but something that includes rational for the method.  Method to the Madness sort of thing.
* How would you describe your work style?
  * Work in large chunks, with small breaks.  Strive for constant forward progress.
* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
  * We have very similar working styles and strengths.  This should lead to a well oiled machine.
* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
  * NA - First paired project
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
  * Results and completion driven.  Directions and decisions are based on the results they give and the progess towards goal they move us.
* How will we overcome obstacles?
  * We both have a very similar working personality, so we have the time to research together for tricky technical obstacles and time together to deal with personality obstacles.  Directed communication.
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
  * Warm - Quiet with little distractions.
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
  * We both have similar schedules in terms of arrival and exiting times.  Beyond that we will check nightly work at leaving Turing.
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
  * Direct with reasoning for change.  As long as the code works strive for finished not perfect until extra time.
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
  * Biggest strengths lie in one member having a background in computer science so logic and structure is easier at the start.  Be patient - using advanced techniques in the project is a goal, but time is needed to learned them.
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
  * Slack and GitHub / Class time.
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
  * By reference ruby docs and example code to get the function to work.  Pseudocoding!
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
  * Success for use is iteration 4 with 4's in all categories.  We can achieve this with efficent time management and early deadlines.
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
  * We are both good just knowing we are moving forward constantly with the project.  Celebrate at iteration 4!

### Template for DTR Memo

Project: 

Group Member Names: Steven Anderson, Ryan Allen

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):  Iteration 4, Github Group training, and 4's in rubric metric.
	
Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):  We are both very results driven, and able to work independently while coming to together and certain points for group work.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:  Make it work, fix it later

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):  Similar arrival and departure times.  Before and after classes.  Recheck in at halfway mark to evaulate deadlines.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):  Communicate daily with morning and evening stand-ups.  Check in at the end of each iteration with gameplan for the next.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):  Group work, we are both used to being very isolated in work so even with matching personalities it will be a challenge.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):  Since this is a first paired project we are going to work on each feature as they come and as we complete the previous.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques): We won't review our own code!  Try and commit each test and each method result.  Branch pushes at end of class and Pull requests when feature done. 

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:  Direct communication but with reason behind it.

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):  Github and Slack

Day 1 Agenda: 

Additional Notes:

Iteration 3 done by Monday morning
Refactoring/Iteration 4/Additional Styling done by project due date
